This is a republished edit of a humorous short-story from my blog. Rated "G" for
 general consumption.

 He sat there frozen in his chair, a look of pained expression plastered on his face.
 The words were unmistakeably ones of awe that escaped his lips, yet were barely
 audible. "I- I'm a what?" "You're a wizard, Harry." "You can't be serious." I spoke as
 if I were calmly explaining something of trivial importance to a child. "No, it's quite
 simple. You're ... quite frankly, one of a kind. This kind I'm referring to, is one that
 has been persecuted for several centuries in the earthen realm, yet has still
 managed to retain its tradition, culture, beliefs, and values whilst living in
 oppression amongst your people, through the most arduous of means available."
 He had been silent for a while now, contemplating what these words meant. He
 knew their meaning, but couldn't make sense of what they were supposed to spell

 For a moment, it seemed though as if he were reaching an epiphany and was short
 of blurting out a cry of a rmation. Instead, he simply shook his head with a
 conviction. "No," he said. "I don't believe you." "I understand. There's no hurry. In

 take priority to disseminate my thoughts in as quickly and e ectively a manner as
 the time given would allow me." "What's the idea behind telling me, then? I'm going
the time given would allow me. Whats the idea behind telling me, then? Im going
 through a crisis at home already, what with Uncle Vernon and my idiot stepbrother
 Dudsley." "Nah, I just felt like messing around with you. You're not a wizard, Harry.
 And I'm not Albus Dumbledore, either." "Ye scurvy sea urchin! Who be this Harry
 ye speak of? I be the fearsome Blackbeard of the Seven Seas!" "...I suppose this is
 the crisis you were referring to."
