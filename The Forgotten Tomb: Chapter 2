 The professor lay back squalid in his chair contemplatively
 sipping his co ee. He faced a round table with lacerations
 among the edges of either side of the table. He replaced the
 mug back onto the coaster and swiveled around to face the
 back wall. He lay with his ngers laced behind his head
 enjoying the warmth of his at. One could not imagine a
 historian – of sorts – surviving on such a meager living. Ah
 yes, to the inexperienced mind it is surviving. But the
 professor was a simple man. He saved his money for the
 more important things in his life – the ones that would last
 him longer in the long run. He had purchased a BlackBerry
 for his work when he was on call and needed quick access to
 clients. That was probably one of the rst and only expensive
 purchase he made recently. He made it a point to never
 spend on an expensive item unless it was absolutely integral
 to the purpose at hand. Speaking from that end, it would be
 unfair to say that the professor did not have an abundance of
 capital. Your rst impression of him may not show it. But he
 had accrued signi cant nancial capital during the initial
 stages of the boom in the eighties. He was a wise investor.
 He knew when to cut his losses – actually he didn’t have to
 because he knew when to quit before he even incurred a
 loss. The professor stared at the TV casting his re ection
 back at him. He had one of his few days o and he wanted to
 spend it as best he could. He didn’t take client calls unless
 they were urgent. Perhaps he’d watch some television. He
 took the remote in his hand and turned it on. The screen
 ickered to life and showed faint images before slowly
 gaining clarity as the TV gained reception.
